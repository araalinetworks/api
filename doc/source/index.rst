Welcome to Araali Networks' Community Edition!
==============================================
Araali Networks Community Edition is dedicated to the hardworking community of
DevOps so as to imbibe a culture of continuous monitoring and security to be an
essential part of the job function. DevOps is about busting silos, and we are
here to bust some more.

We seek to make it easy and fun. We uplift the grammar of network security to
make it meaningful for the DevOps audience.

This has a transformative effect on security because an air-gapped environment
is quite secure. What brings insecurity ought to fix it too. And that we do
with zero trust - simplified to its essence, and democratized. It's rare for
something to be simple, and yet uplift the security posture all at once. And on
top of it make a promise of no harm.

Through our assessments, we hope you will find answers to the following questions:

   - Where are my crown jewels?
   - Who is accessing them?
   - Are services accidentally overexposed to the public Internet?

So let the show begin!

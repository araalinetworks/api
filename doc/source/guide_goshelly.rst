Guide for Araali GoShelly
=========================

Araali GoShelly is an open source tool that helps security teams safely test their detect and response readiness (the fire drill for SIEM/SOAR/EDR/NDR/XDR investment) 
for backdoors. This is typical when supply chain vulnerabilities like remote code execution (RCE) are exploited and represents a doomsday scenario where an attacker
has full remote control capabilities based on the backdoor.


Installation
------------

Similar to the deprecated version of this tool, Araali Shelly, GoShelly offers the option to run your own 
backdoor and/or use the already running backdoor offered by Araali to listen for incoming connections.

Setup a backdoor service
_________________________

To use your own backdoor server
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
On a k8s cluster install and configure GoShelly server using the following instructions.
NOTE: These installation steps assume that you have Helm and kubectl - the package manager and command line tool for k8s - installed and setup already.
    1.  Add Araali's Helm repository
        ::
            helm repo add araali-helm https://araalinetworks.github.io/araali-helm/
    2.  Install GoShelly Server
        ::
            helm install goshelly-server araali-helm/goshelly-server

    3.  Get the loadbalancer external IP for the client to connect to
        ::
            kubectl get svc -n goshelly-helm
        Save the external IP to the service named "goshelly-helm-port-forwarding" for later use, when setting up the GoShelly client.
    Uninstall GoShelly Server::

        helm uninstall goshelly-server

To use Araali's backdoor server
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Nothing. It's already running. Follow the instructions below to dial to our backdoor server using GoShelly Client.


Setup GoShelly Client
_____________________
On the machine, you wish to test the attack response readiness for, install and configure GoShelly Client 
using the following instructions.
    1.  Download GoShelly Client
        On Linux::

            curl -O https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/araalinetworks.cf/goshelly_linux 

        On Mac::

            curl -O https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/araalinetworks.cf/goshelly_darwin 

    2.  Make it executable
        ::
            chmod +x goshelly_*

    3.  Run the below command to make the GoShelly Client dial out to the backdoor server

        * If you choose to use Araali's backdoor service use the command as shown below.
            For Linux::

                ./goshelly_linux assess
            For MacOS::

                ./goshelly_darwin assess


        * If you choose to use your own backdoor service, include the loadbalancer external IP address, we previously noted, using the IP flag in the assess command as shown below.
            For Linux::

                ./goshelly_linux assess --IP <IP_ADDRESS>
            For MacOS::

                ./goshelly_darwin assess --IP <IP_ADDRESS>
    4.  Wait for GoShelly to run on your system and return results. You may also check your Araali Console to view GoShelly in action.
